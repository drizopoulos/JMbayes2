# Baseline Hazard Function
The submodel for the event process in the joint models fitted in **JMbayes2** is a relative hazard model postulating a multiplicative effect of the covariates in the hazard scale. The default specification of the baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ takes the form: $$\log \{ h_0(t) \} = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^P \gamma_p B_p(t, \lambda),$$
where $B_p(t, \lambda)$ denotes the $p$-th basis function of a B-spline with knots $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_P$ and $\gamma$ the vector of spline coefficients. To ensure smoothness of the baseline hazard function, we postulate a 'penalized' prior distribution for the spline coefficients $\gamma$: 

$$p(\gamma \mid \tau) \propto \tau^{\rho(K)/2}\exp \left (-\frac{\tau}{2} \gamma^\top K \gamma \right ),$$

where $\tau$ is the smoothing parameter that takes a $\mbox{Gamma}(5, 0.5)$ hyper-prior to ensure a proper posterior, $K = \Delta_r^\top \Delta_r$, where $\Delta_r$ denotes $r$-th difference penalty matrix, and $\rho(K)$ denotes the rank of $K$. Different baseline hazard functions can be specified using the `base_hazard` and `control` arguments of `jm()`. We will illustrate this capability using the AIDS dataset. We start with the default joint model for the time to death and the longitudinal measurements of the square root transformed CD4 cell counts:
```{r, 'Cox_and_LMM'}
# Cox regression
CoxFit <- coxph(Surv(Time, death) ~ drug, data = aids.id)

# a linear mixed model for sqrt(CD4) cell count
fm <- lme(CD4 ~ ns(obstime, 2) * drug, data = aids,
           random = list(patient = pdDiag(~ ns(obstime, 2))))

# default baseline hazard
jointFit1 <- jm(CoxFit, fm, time_var = "obstime")
```

By default, the knots $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_P$ are placed equidistantly in the interval $(10^{-8}, T_{max})$, where $T_{max}$ is the maximum follow-up time. The number of knots is specified by the control argument `base_hazard_segments`, which has a default value of 9. The degree of the polynomials in the B-spline basis is specified by the control argument `Bsplines_degree`; the default is 2, i.e., quadratic polynomials. The value of $r$ in the penalty matrix $\Delta_r$ is specified by the control argument `diff`; by default, second-order differences are used. The internal function `JMbayes2:::plot_hazard()` can be used to depict the estimated baseline hazard function:
```{r, 'default JM - estimated base hazard', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit1)
```

The default specification assumes a B-spline approximation for the time variable in its original scale. However, as argued in the [**flexsurv** package](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/flexsurv/html/flexsurvspline.html), this specification may have the undesirable property that the cumulative hazard function does not approach zero at time zero. Additionally, the default approximation of the baseline hazard is based on a B-spline basis with quadratic piecewise polynomial functions. We override both of these settings by specifying a natural cubic spline (also known as restricted cubic spline) basis for the logarithm of time using the `base_hazard` argument:
```{r, 'log time', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
jointFit2 <- update(jointFit1, base_hazard = "log time, ns")
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit2)
```

Setting `base_hazard = "log time, ns"` corresponds to setting the control arguments `timescale_base_hazard = "log"` and `basis = "ns"`. Using regular expressions look-up of the user input in the `base_hazard` argument, the `jm()` function attempts to set the corresponding control arguments. For example, the following call would also set natural cubic splines with the log time: `update(jointFit1, base_hazard = "ns, log-time")`.

To fit a piecewise-constant baseline hazard function by splitting the follow-up period into five equidistant intervals, we use the call (note that the piecewise-constant approximation is defined for time in its original scale again):
```{r, 'piecewise constant', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
jointFit3 <- update(jointFit1, base_hazard = "piecewise constant",
                    base_hazard_segments = 5L)
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit3)
```

A piecewise-linear baseline hazard function for the log time variable with three interconnected lines is fitted using the syntax:
```{r, 'piecewise linear', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
jointFit4 <- update(jointFit1, base_hazard = "piecewise linear, log time",
                    base_hazard_segments = 3L, 
                    priors = list(penalized_bs_gammas = FALSE))
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit4)
```

Via the `priors` argument, we specified that the $\gamma$ coefficients for the piecewise-linear baseline hazard should not be penalized. In this case, they have a normal prior with a mean zero and variance 10.

The Weibull baseline hazard function in the log scale corresponds to a simple linear model with an intercept and a slope term for the logarithm of the time variable. Hence, it is a special case of the models we considered above. We can fit a joint model with the Weibull baseline hazard using the call:
```{r, 'weibull', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
jointFit5 <- update(jointFit1, base_hazard = "weibull")
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit5)
```

This baseline hazard function also allows extrapolating beyond the range of observed event times. Actually, extrapolation is possible whenever a natural cubic spline basis is used. In the following figure, we extrapolate until month 24:
```{r, 'weibull-ext', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
JMbayes2:::plot_hazard(jointFit5, tmax = 24)
```
