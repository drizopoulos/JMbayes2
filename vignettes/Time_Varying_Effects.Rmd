# Non Proportional Hazards
The basic definition of the joint model assumes the coefficients that quantify the association between the versions of the longitudinal outcomes and the hazard of the event are time-constant (i.e., the proportional hazards assumption). We can relax this assumption by specifying time-varying coefficients via the `functional_forms` argument of function `jm()`.

We will illustrate this capability using the PBC dataset. We start by fitting a Cox model for the composite event transplantation or death, including sex as a baseline covariate:
```{r}
pbc2.id$status2 <- as.numeric(pbc2.id$status != 'alive')
CoxFit <- coxph(Surv(years, status2) ~ sex, data = pbc2.id)
```

Our aim is to assess the strength of the association between the risk of the composite event and the level of serum bilirubin. We will describe the patient-specific profiles over time for this biomarker using a linear mixed-effects model, where both in the fixed- and random-effects we include an intercept, the linear and quadratic time effect. In the fixed-effects we also include the interaction of the time effect and sex. The syntax to fit this model with `lme()` is:
```{r}
fm <- lme(log(serBilir) ~ poly(year, 2) * sex, data = pbc2, 
          random = ~ poly(year, 2) | id, control = lmeControl(opt = 'optim'))
```

The default call to `jm()` adds the subject-specific linear predictor of the mixed model as a time-varying covariate in the survival relative risk model:
```{r}
jointFit1 <- jm(CoxFit, fm, time_var = "year")
summary(jointFit1)
```

To specify that the association of serum bilirubin may change over time we include an interaction of this time-varying covariate with a natural cubic spline of time using function `ns()` from the **splines** package. **Important Note:** for this to work correctly we need to explicitly specify the internal and boundary knots for the B-splines basis, i.e., in the following example we set the internal knots at 3, 6 and 9 years, and the boundary knots at 0 and 14.5 years:
```{r}
form_splines <- ~ value(log(serBilir)) * ns(year, k = c(3, 6, 9), B = c(0, 14.5))
jointFit2 <- update(jointFit1, functional_forms = form_splines, 
                    n_iter = 6500L, n_burnin = 2500L)
summary(jointFit2)
```

The spline coefficients do not have a straightforward interpretation. We therefore visualize the time-varying association of log serum bilirubin with the hazard of the composite event using the following piece of code: 
```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 7.5}
x_times <- seq(0.001, 12, length = 501)
X <- cbind(1, ns(x_times, knots = c(3, 6, 9), B = c(0, 14.5)))
mcmc_alphas <- do.call('rbind', jointFit2$mcmc$alphas)
log_hr <- X %*% t(mcmc_alphas)
log_hr_mean <- rowMeans(log_hr)
log_hr_low <- apply(log_hr, 1, quantile, probs = 0.025)
log_hr_upp <- apply(log_hr, 1, quantile, probs = 0.975)

matplot(x_times, cbind(exp(log_hr_mean), exp(log_hr_low), exp(log_hr_upp)), 
        type = "l", col = c("red", "black", "black"), lty = c(1, 2, 2), lwd = 2,
        xlab = "Follow-up Time (years)", ylab = "Hazard Ratio log serum Bilirubin",
        ylim = c(0.5, 6.4))
abline(h = exp(coef(jointFit1)$association), lty = 2, col = "red")
abline(h = 1, lty = 2)
legend("topright", c("time-varying coefficient", "proportional hazards"),
       lty = c(1, 2), lwd = c(2, 1), col = "red", bty = "n")
```

We observe that the 95% credible interval for the time-varying coefficient includes the horizontal line that corresponds to proportional hazards. This is also confirmed by comparing the two models:
```{r}
compare_jm(jointFit1, jointFit2)
```

Both the WAIC and LPML indicate that `jointFit1` is a better model than `jointFit2`. The DIC has the same magnitude for both models.
